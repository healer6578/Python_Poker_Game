"DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE CODE!!!"

This is a simple 'Black_jack' game, a simple mini project created by me, myself and I.
Using some python coding that was taught to me.

This game is similar to the real 'Black jack'
Getting 21 to win, getting more than 21 is burst.
Press enter till dealer & player has acquire they're 2nd card, you will be able choose to either press "h" or "s":
type "H" or "h" to [hit]:
or
type "S" or "s" to [stand]:
["Hit" means you will receive another card, while "Stand" indicates that you do not wish to receive another card.]

Hope you enjoy the game!!!
